### Profiling Data

This directory serves as a location to see performances of this script. Profiling is done with the [pyinstrument](https://github.com/joerick/pyinstrument) module. For each model that is profiled, there are saved artifacts in various ways you can view them.

By default, you can open the corresponding html page that pyinstrument will produce.

If you prefer [SpeedScope](https://www.speedscope.app/), you may upload the speedscope artifact.

Lastly, we have `pstats` and `json` variations.
